                    Human body contains approximately 37.2 trillion cells. Normally, human cells grow and divide to form new cells as the body needs them. When cells grow old or become damaged, they die, and new cells take their place. Sometimes, cells mutate (change) and begin to grow and divide more quickly than normal cells. Rather than dying, these abnormal cells clump together to form tumours. If these tumours are cancerous (also called malignant tumours), they can invade and kill healthy tissues. From these tumors, cancer cells can metastasize (spread) and form new tumors in other parts of the body. By contrast, noncancerous tumors (also called benign tumors) do not spread to other parts of the body. Cancer cells can spread to other parts of the body through the blood and lymph systems. Cancer can start almost anywhere in the human body. There are many different types of cancer, but all cancers begin with abnormal cells growing out of control. The most common cancers in adults are <strong>skin cancer,</strong> lung cancer, <strong>colon cancer, rectal cancer, breast cancer, endometrial cancer,</strong> ovarian cancer and <strong>prostate cancer.</strong><br/>

Data also revealed that only 12.5 per cent of patients come for treatment in early stages of the disease. Among females, breast cancer topped the list and among males mouth cancer. "Cancer of breast with estimated 1.5 lakh (over 10 per cent of all cancers) new cases during 2016, is the number one cancer overall. Cancer of the lung is the next with estimated 1.14 lakh (83,000 in males and 31,000 in females) new cases during 2016 and 1.4 lakh cases in 2020. "Cancer of the cervix is the third most common cancer with estimated 1 lakh new cases in 2016 and about 1.04 lakh during 2020.

                    A carcinogen is something (chemical, radiation, etc) which can damage a cell and make it more likely to turn into a cancerous cell. As a general rule, the more the exposure to a carcinogen, the greater the risk.
                    <ul class="margin-top-10">
                        <li class="margin-bottom-5"> physical carcinogens, such as ultraviolet and ionizing radiation;</li>
                        <li class="margin-bottom-5">chemical carcinogens, such as asbestos, components of tobacco smoke, aflatoxin (a food contaminant), and arsenic (a drinking water contaminant); and </li>
                        <li class="margin-bottom-10">biological carcinogens, such as infections from certain viruses, bacteria, or parasites Tobacco use, alcohol use, unhealthy diet, and physical inactivity are major cancer risk factors worldwide </li>
                    </ul>
                        Common environmental factors that contribute to cancer death include tobacco (according to one estimate, accounting for 25–30% of deaths), obesity (30–35%), infections (15–20%), radiation (both ionizing and non-ionizing, up to 10%), lack of physical activity, and environmental pollutants.<br/>

                    Over 30% of cancers are potentially avoidable by reducing key risk factors, of which much the significant is tobacco use, which is the cause of about 22% of cancer deaths. Another 10% is due to obesity, a poor diet, lack of physical activity, and drinking alcohol. In the developing world nearly 20% of cancers are due to infections such as hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and human papillomavirus. These factors act, at least partly, by changing the genes of a cell. Typically many such genetic changes are required before cancer develops. Approximately 5–10% of cancers are due to genetic defects inherited from a person's parents.<br/>

                <strong><i> Prevention: </i></strong>
                <div class="margin-top-10">
                    A person’s cancer risk can be reduced with healthy choices like avoiding tobacco, limiting alcohol use, protecting your skin from the sun and avoiding indoor tanning, eating a diet rich in fruits and vegetables, keeping a healthy weight, and being physically active.<br/>

                    Between 30–50% of cancers can currently be prevented. This can be accomplished by avoiding risk factors and implementing existing evidence-based prevention strategies. The cancer burden can also be reduced through early detection of cancer and management of patients who develop cancer. Many cancers have a high chance of cure if diagnosed early and treated adequately.<br/>

                        A correct cancer diagnosis is essential for adequate and effective treatment because every cancer type requires a specific treatment regimen that encompasses one or more modalities such as surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy. The primary goal is generally to cure cancer or to considerably prolong life. Improving the patient's quality of life is also an important goal. This can be achieved by supportive or palliative care and psychosocial support.
