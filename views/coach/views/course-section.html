                            Combination skin is usually dry or normal in some areas but oily in the T-zone – a fancy name for the forehead, nose, and chin area of your face. If this is your skin type, you might be struggling with enlarged pores, blackheads, and some grease and shine along your T-zone.

                            Combination skin is usually dry or normal in some areas but oily in the T-zone – a fancy name for
                            the forehead, nose, and chin area of your face. If this is your skin type, you might be
                            struggling with enlarged pores, blackheads, and some grease and shine along your T-zone.<br/><br/>
                            <strong>Dry Skin</strong><br/>
                            Dry skin does not hold oil and moisture well. It feels tight and can become rough, itchy,
                            and flaky. If this is your skin type, use a gentle cleanser and avoid washing your face too
                            many times. Apply and re-apply a rich moisturiser throughout the day.<br/><br/>
                            <strong>Oily Skin</strong><br/>
                            Oily skin usually gets shiny or greasy pretty quickly. This is because this skin type
                            produces extra oil, which can eventually clog pores, attract germs, and cause acne.
                            If this is your skin type, fight the urge to pop or prick your pimples! Stick to
                            skincare products that are oil-free and non-comedogenic, meaning they won’t clog pores.<br/><br/>
                            <strong>Sensitive Skin</strong><br/>
                            Sensitive skin is easily irritated, becoming itchy, red, painful, and dry.
                            If this is your skin type, find out which factors trigger a reaction and avoid
                            them. It’s better to confirm with your dermatologist which product from the
                            CLEAN & CLEAR® range will suit you best.<br/><br/>
