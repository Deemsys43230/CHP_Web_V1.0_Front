Calorie counting will only stress you out and make you feel miserable every time you bite into anything edible. What you want is something you can maintain your whole life, not just for a month or two. Eating reasonably and mindfully will very soon become the norm if the terms are minimal. Think of it this way, high value foods have to be earned - candy, baked goods, sodas. Just because you want to lead a healthy lifestyle it doesn&#39;t mean you can never touch any of it ever again, it only means that they can no longer be on your daily menu, better things should. Real food is usually the way to go, cooked food with the fewest ingredients possible. Homemade and fresh is what you want."},{title:"How To Use Green Tea For Weight Loss",code:"wyVOHavaT7U",image:"../../images/youtube/2.jpg",description:"Green tea is the healthiest beverage on the planet.

Some of the benefits of jogging won&#39;t show up for weeks, while other benefits can be enjoyed more quickly.

There are many different styles of yoga, some more physical than others. The most well known types include Hatha, Ashtanga, Kundalini, Raja and Tantric yoga. People usually choose one depending on their needs, physical abilities and preferences. Yoga is often associated with a set of postures, but there is much more to it, including the specific theory about the human physiology, which involves the study of energy channels and energy centers or chakras. We have two types of autonomic nervous system: the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) and the parasympathetic nervous system (PNS). The first is responsible for the fight or flight reaction, while the latter deals with the rest and digest setting of the body. In other words, the SNS concerns stress, while the PNS is all about relaxation. In these busy, competitive, demanding and alienating times, the SNS is the one working overtime, while the PNS doesn&#39;t get activated as often as it should, if we are to have a balanced body and mind. When you do yoga, the PNS gets woken up, which results in the blissful feelings of relaxation. Physiologically speaking, the PNS lowers blood pressure, slows the heart rate and redirects blood toward the digestive system. Basically, it takes care of those parts of the body which are neglected when the SNS is in charge."},{title:"Total Body Stretch - Flexibility Exercises for the Entire Body",code:"KJaWIBg15n0",image:"../../images/youtube/5.jpg",description:"<div>Stretching is an important part on any exercise plan.

He doesn&#39;t only possess a pair of fast hands and feet and quick body movement, but he has other qualities such as non-telegraphic moves, good coordination, perfect balance and keen awareness. Although some people are endowed with a few of these qualities, most of these attributes are developed through hard training. All the strength or power you have developed from your training is wasted if you are slow and can&#39;t make contact. Power and speed go hand-in-hand. A fighter needs both to be successful. One immediate way to increase your speed at impact is to &#34;snap&#34; or &#34;whip&#34; your hand just before contact. It is the same principle as the overhand throw. For example, if you throw a baseball with a full swing and snap your wrist at the last moment or the tail end of your swing, the ball will have more velocity than without the snap. Naturally, the longer swing with a snap will have more acceleration at the end than a shorter swing with a snap. To have speed and snap in your punching, your muscles and tendons need to be loose and explosive, one quick way to achieve this applying Tendon Warming Liniment on your wrists, elbows, shoulders and triceps prior to stretching and working out, this creates a explosive snap in your punching."},{title:"How To Gain Weight And Build Muscle Mass Fast And Naturally",code:"fObDpfJBl0k",image:"../../images/youtube/9.jpg",description:"Do you need to put on a few pounds to make a sports team, better your health, or simply to bulk up?

Even if you don&#39;t have a specific reason for increasing your height, being tall provides many advantages. It can boost your confidence, save you from wearing uncomfortable high heels, or simply make it easier to reach that top shelf without having to climb onto a wobbly stool. A person&#39;s height is determined to a great extent by genetics, but it is not necessarily the only determinant. There is a hormone in the body known as <strong>Human Growth Hormone (HGH)</strong> that regulates height. HGH is produced by the pituitary gland and is highly essential for the growth of long bones and cartilage. Several other factors play a key role in determining height, such as smoking during pregnancy, poor post-natal care, low birth weight and poor health during childhood. Exercise and sports stimulate the release of growth hormone that contributes to your height. To enjoy good height, you must exercise regularly and take part in sports activities. One good exercise to increase height is skipping where you need to jump a lot. Do skipping for at least 30 minutes each day in an open area. Holding on to a horizontal bar and hanging with your spine stretched out is another effective exercise to facilitate height gain. Stay in the position for 10 seconds and repeat at least six times daily. Plus, play games like tennis and basketball that require you to jump a lot. This will help increase your height and also help in maintaining ideal body weight. Also indulge in outdoor activities, like cycling and swimming, on a regular basis to enjoy good height and a toned body."},{title:"How to Tighten Excess Skin After Weight Loss",code:"MTr299XffoI",image:"../../images/youtube/11.jpg",description:"In addition to being one of your visible organs, the skin is also the largest.
