Weight maintenance with lifestyle modification – although challenging – is possible but requires long-term support to reinforce diet, physical activity and behavioural changes. Physical activity is a perennial factor of obesity prevention. Sleep restriction increases food intake and total energy expenditure with inconsistent effects on integrated energy balance as operationalized by weight change.<br><br><strong>References,</strong><br>Ruopeng An, “Prevalence and Trends of Adult Obesity in the US, 1999 – 2012,” ISRN Obesity, vol. 2014, Article ID 185132, 6 pages, 2014. doi: 10.1155/2014/185132</div></div></div><br><br></div></div></div></div></div><script type="text/javascript" src="../../js/script.js"></script>
