ADHD is a common behavioral disorder that affects about 10% of school-age children. Boys are about three times more likely than girls to be diagnosed with ADHA. The disorder is characterized by developmentally inappropriate functioning in the domains of inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity. ADHD begins in childhood and often persists into adulthood. Children with ADHD may have trouble paying attention, controlling impulsive behaviours (may act without thinking about what the result will be), or be overly active (CDC) .An estimated 5 percent of children and 2.5 percent of adults have ADHD.<br></div><div class="margin-top-10"><h4 class="margin-bottom-10"><strong><i>Signs and Symptoms:</i></strong></h4>Symptoms of ADHD include inattention (not being able to keep focus), hyperactivity (excess movement that is not fitting to the setting) and impulsivity (hasty acts that occur in the moment without thought).<br><div class="col-md-6 no-padding margin-bottom-10">Children with ADHD<br><ul class="margin-top-10"><li class="margin-bottom-5">Get distracted easily and forget things often</li><li class="margin-bottom-5">Talk without stopping and interrupting people</li><li class="margin-bottom-5">Change quickly from one activity to another</li><li class="margin-bottom-5">Make careless mistakes or take unnecessary risks</li><li class="margin-bottom-5">Having a short attention span and being easily distracted</li><li class="margin-bottom-5">Appearing to be unable to listen to or carry out instructions</li><li class="margin-bottom-5">Appearing forgetful or losing things</li><li class="margin-bottom-5">Fidgeting and squirming</li><li class="margin-bottom-5">Having problems finishing things like homework and housework</li><li class="margin-bottom-5">Problems in staying focused at one activity, like- study tasks and play</li><li class="margin-bottom-5">Avoids or dislikes the activities that require mental efforts.</li><li class="margin-bottom-5">The child has difficulty in waiting for his/her turn in games or in queues</li><li>being unable to sit still, especially in calm or quiet surroundings</li></ul></div><div class="col-md-6 padding-right-0"><img src="../../images/diseaseControlTips/tips-1-2.jpg" style="height: 370px"><br><br></div><div class="margin-top-5">Between 30% and 70% of children with ADHD will continue to display symptoms of the disorder in adulthood. Conservative estimates of ADHD prevalence in adults suggest that nearly 1 in 20 adults in the general population have ADHD.<br></div><div class="margin-top-10"><h5 class="margin-bottom-10"><i><strong>Causes:</strong></i><br></h5>The cause(s) and risk factors for ADHD are unknown, but current research shows that genetics plays an important role. Recent studies of twins link genes with ADHD.<br><ul class="margin-top-10"><h5 class="margin-bottom-10"><li><i>Brain function and structure:</i></li></h5><div class="margin-top-10">Brain chemicals or neurotransmitters are said to have a role in ADHD. Two main neurotransmitters involved in ADHD as per the researches are dopamine and norepinephrine. Neurotransmitters affect the signals across the brain. The studies have found that the children who have ADHD have 4% smaller brains in comparison to children without ADHD.<br></div><li class="margin-top-10">Brain damage either in the womb or in the first few years of life</li><li class="margin-top-10">Exposure to environmental (e.g., lead or pesticides in early childhood)</li><li class="margin-top-10">Alcohol, tobacco or misusing drugs during pregnancy</li><li class="margin-top-10">Premature delivery (before the 37th week of pregnancy)</li><li class="margin-top-10">Low birth weight</li></ul><div class="margin-top-10">Research does not support the popularly held views that ADHD is caused by eating too much sugar, watching too much television, parenting, or social and environmental factors such as poverty or family chaos. Of course, many things, including these, might make symptoms worse, especially in certain people. But the evidence is not strong enough to conclude that they are the main causes of ADHD.</div></div><div class="text-center"><ul class="pager"><li ng-click="pageNo=2" onclick="window.scrollTo(0,0)"><a class="main-button" href="">Next Page <i class="fa fa-angle-right"></i> </a></li></ul></div></div></div></div><div class="text-justify col-md-12 margin-top-10" ng-show="pageNo==2"><div class="margin-bottom-10 no-padding"><i><strong>Prevalence:</strong></i><br><div class="margin-top-10 no-padding"><strong>GLOBAL</strong><br><div class="margin-top-10">A meta-analysis of 175 research studies worldwide on ADHD prevalence in children aged 18 and under found an overall pooled estimate of 7.2% (Thomas et al. 2015).

Children who have ADHD may get better with treatment, but there is no cure. There are three basic types of treatment:</div><div class="col-md-8 no-padding"><div class="margin-top-10"><h5 class="margin-bottom-10"><strong>1. Medications.</strong></h5>Several medications may help. The most common types are called stimulants. Medications help children concentrate, learn, and be calm.<br>Sometimes medications cause side effects, such as sleep problems or stomach pains. It may be necessary for your child to try some medications to see which one works best. It is important that you and the doctor closely observe your child while taking the medicine.<br></div><div class="margin-top-10"><h5 class="margin-bottom-10"><strong>2. Therapy.</strong></h5>There are different kinds of therapy. Behavioral therapy can help teach children to control their behavior so they can perform better at school and at home.<br></div><div class="margin-top-10"><h5 class="margin-bottom-10"><strong>3. Combination therapy and medications.</strong></h5>Many children get better with medication and therapy.<br></div></div><div class="col-md-4 padding-right-0"><img src="../../images/diseaseControlTips/tips-1-3.jpg"><br></div><div class="margin-top-10 no-padding"><h4 class="margin-bottom-10"><i><strong>Treatment Data:</strong></i></h4>About 2 million of the more than 6 million children with ADHD were diagnosed before age 6. Children diagnosed with ADHD at an early age tend to have the most severe symptoms and benefit from early treatment. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that before prescribing medicine to a young child, healthcare providers refer parents to training in behavior therapy.<br></div><div class="text-justify margin-top-10"><h5 class="margin-bottom-10"><b>Children</b></h5>According to data from the 2003–2011 National Survey of Children’s Health (NCHS), 3.5 million children (69% of children with current ADHD as reported by parents) were taking medication for ADHD (CDC, 2014).<br></div><div class="margin-top-10"><h5 class="margin-bottom-10"><strong>Teens & Young Adults</strong></h5>Data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey which included 62,699 teens (aged 12–17 years) and young adults (aged 18–23 years) during years 2003–2012, found rates of ADHD medication use increased for both teens and young adults. The medications included amphetamines, methylphenidates and atomoxetine. Use of these medications increased for teens from 4.2% in 2003–2004 to 6% in 2011–2012. For young adults, medication use increased from 1.2% in 2003–2004 to 2.6% in 2011–2012 (Johansen, 2015).<br></div><div class="margin-top-10"><h5 class="margin-bottom-10"><i><strong>Diet</strong></i></h5>People with ADHD should eat a healthy, balanced diet. Don't cut out foods before seeking medical advice.<br>Some people may notice a link between types of food and worsening ADHD symptoms. For example, sugar, food colourings and additives, and caffeine are often blamed for aggravating hyperactivity, and some people believe they have intolerances to wheat or dairy products, which may add to their symptoms.<br></div><div class="margin-top-10 no-padding"><h5 class="margin-bottom-10"><i><strong>Exercise</strong></i></h5>Make sure your child gets lots of physical activity during the day. Walking, skipping and playing sport can help your child wear themselves out and improve their quality of sleep. Make sure they're not doing anything too strenuous or exciting near to bedtime<br><br></div><div class="margin-top-10 no-padding"><b><i>References:</i></b><br><ul class="margin-top-10"><li class="margin-bottom-10"><a href="https://www.seenso.com/" target="_blank">https://www.seenso.com/</a></li><li class="margin-bottom-10"><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/adhd/facts.html#1" target="_blank">https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/adhd/facts.html#1</a></li></ul>Jyothsna Akam Venkata, Anuja S Panicker, <strong>2013.</strong> Prevalence of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in primary school children, vol.55 & 4, 338-342.<br></div><div class="text-center"><ul class="pager"><li ng-click="pageNo=2" onclick="window.scrollTo(0,0)"><a class="main-button" href=""><i class="fa fa-angle-left"></i> Previous Page</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div>
