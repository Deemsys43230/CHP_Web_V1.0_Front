Globally, physical inactivity is estimated to cause around 27% of diabetes, 30% of ischaemic heart disease and 21%–25% of breast and colon cancer.

In high-income countries, 26% of men and 35% of women were insufficiently physically active, as compared to 12% of men and 24% of women in low-income countries.Globally, 81% of adolescents aged 11-17 years were insufficiently physically active in 2010.<br><br>Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans recommend that adults get at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity physical activity, or an equivalent combination each week. The guidelines also recommend that children and adolescents be active for at least 60 minutes every day. Following these guidelines can contribute to overall health, and decrease the risk of chronic diseases such as heart disease, cancer or diabetes.<br><br>Walking is a great way to get the physical activity needed to obtain health benefits. Walking does not require any special skills. A minimum of 30 minutes of physical activity of moderate intensity (e.g., brisk walking) Walking is encouraged as one of the most accessible ways to be physically active is the most commonly reported leisure- time physical activity (LTPA) in the United States, and is relatively common among groups that are typically inactive (e.g., the elderly and low-income groups).<br><br><strong>Research has shown that walking at least 30 minutes a day can help you to:</strong><br><ul class="margin-top-10"><li>Reduce the risk of coronary heart disease and stroke</li><li>Improve blood pressure, blood sugar levels and blood lipid profile</li><li>Maintain body weightand lower the risk of obesity</li><li>Enhance mental well-being</li><li>Reduce risk of osteoporosis, breast and colon cancer, non-insulin dependent (type 2) diabetes</li></ul><strong>Physical activity - U.S. National: Data and trends (CDC)</strong><br><br><div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2"><table class="table table-bordered table-striped"><thead><tr class="backyellow text-white"><td>Indicator</td><td>Data</td><td>Sample size</td><td>Year</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Adults who engage in no leisure time physical activity</td><td>23.7%</td><td>454,431</td><td>2014</td></tr><tr><td>Adults aerobically active 150 minutes</td><td>50.2%</td><td>433,081</td><td>2013</td></tr><tr><td>Adults aerobically active 300 minutes</td><td>31.2%</td><td>429,607</td><td>2013</td></tr><tr><td>Adults meeting muscle strengthening guidelines</td><td>29.6%</td><td>444,324</td><td>2013</td></tr><tr><td>Adults meeting aerobic and muscle strengthening guidelines</td><td>20.2%</td><td>428,975</td><td>2013</td></tr><tr><td>Adolescents who are physically active daily</td><td>27.1%</td><td>13,310</td><td>2013</td></tr><tr><td>Adolescents who participate in daily physical education</td><td>29.4%</td><td>13, 228</td><td>2013</td></tr><tr><td>Adults who usually walk or bike to work</td><td>3.4%</td><td>N/A</td><td>2009-2011</td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class="col-md-12 no-padding"><div class="text-center"><small>Source: Centre for disease control and prevention (CDC) - USA</small></div><br>According to American community survey, number of U.S. workers who travelled to work by bicycle increased from about 488,000 in 2000 to about 786,000 in 2008 – 2012. Workers living in principal cities walked to work are at a rate of 4.3 percent, compared with 2.4 percent for works in suburbs. Several “college towns” showed high rates of walking to work, including Ithaca, NY, and Athens, OH where about 42 percent and 37 percent of workers walked to work, respectively (Brian McKenzie, 2014).<br><br><div class="text-center"><img class="text-center" src="../../images/healthyTips/tips-10-2.jpg"><br><small>Source: US, census bureau, American community survey, 2008 – 2012.</small><br><br><i>Some physical activity is better than doing none.</i><br><br><h5 class="text-bold">“Be Active”</h5></div><br><br><b><i>References:</i></b><br><ul class="margin-top-10"><li>Physical activity, World Health Organisation, Geneva, 2015.</li><li>Brian McKenzie , May2014 Modes Less Traveled—Bicycling and Walking to Work in the United States: 2008 - 2012.</li><li>www.census.gov/acs/www/.</li><li>https://nccd.cdc.gov/NPAO_DTM/.</li></ul><br><b><i>Related Links:</i></b><br><ul class="margin-top-10"><li><a href="http://health.gov/paguidelines/" target="_blank">http://health.gov/paguidelines/</a></li><li><a href="http://www.letsmove.gov/get-active" target="_blank">http://www.letsmove.gov/get-active</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div></div><script type="text/javascript" src="../../js/script.js"></script>
