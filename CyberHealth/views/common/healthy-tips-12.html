Adults with diabetes have a 2-4 times higher risk for heart disease or stroke, compared with those without diabetes (American Heart Association, 2014)<br><br>Currently, about 30 million Americans have type 2 diabetes, resulting in two deaths every five minutes in this country. Additionally, 86 million Americans have a high risk of developing diabetes, because one in every three adults has pre diabetes, a condition that arises when blood glucose levels are higher than normal but not high enough for a diagnosis of diabetes.<br><br>New cases of diagnosed diabetes among people aged 20 years or older, united states, 2012<br><br><div class="col-md-6 col-md-offset-3"><table class="table table-bordered text-left"><tbody><tr><td class="text-bold">Age</td><td class="text-bold"><i>Number of new diabetes cases</i></td></tr><tr><td class="text-bold"><i>Total</i></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>20 years or older</td><td>1.7 million</td></tr><tr><td class="text-bold"><i>By age</i></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>20 -44</td><td>371,000</td></tr><tr><td>45-64</td><td>892,000</td></tr><tr><td>65 years or older</td><td>400,000</td></tr></tbody></table><div class="text-center"><small>Source: 2010 – 2012 National Health Interview survey, 2009 – 2012 National health and Nutrition Examination survey.</small></div><br></div><div class="col-md-6 col-md-offset-3"><table class="table-bordered table text-left"><tbody><tr><td class="text-bold">Medication</td><td class="text-bold">Number if adults using diabetes mediaction (million)</td></tr><tr><td>Insulin only</td><td>2.9</td></tr><tr><td>Both Insulin and oral medication</td><td>3.1</td></tr><tr><td>Oral Medication only</td><td>11.9</td></tr><tr><td>Neither insulin nor oral medication</td><td>3.0s</td></tr></tbody></table><div class="text-center"><small>Source: 2010 – 2012 National Health Interview survey.</small></div><br></div><div class="col-md-12 no-padding">Type 2 diabetes is largely preventable. About 9 cases in 10 could be avoided by taking several simple steps: keeping weight under control, exercising more, eating a healthy diet, and not smoking.<br><ul class="margin-top-10"><li>Achieve and maintain a healthy body weight.</li><li>Become active and stay active throughout the life course.</li><li>Eat a healthy diet of between 3 and 5 servings of fruit and vegetables each day and reduce sugar, salt and saturated fat intake.</li><li>Avoid tobacco use – smoking increases the risk of heart attacks and strokes.</li></ul>The potential impact of simple diet modifications and increased physical activity on preventing and improving diabetes is huge.<br><br>Type 2 diabetes is an increasingly common chronic condition with a worldwide prevalence estimated to reach 439 million by 2030.<br><br>Physical exercise is associated with reduced risk of heart disease, type II diabetes mellitus, and overall mortality.<br><br>Keeping weight in check, being active, and eating a healthy diet can prevent most cases of type 2 diabetes.<br><br>Overweight increases the chances of developing type 2 diabetes seven fold. Obese makes you 20 to 40 times more likely to develop diabetes (Hu et al.,2001). Losing 7 to 10 percent of your current weight can cut your chances of developing type 2 diabetes in half.<br><br>Inactivity promotes type 2 diabetes. 30 minutes brisk walking reduces the risk of developing type 2 diabetes by 30 percent.<br><br>Every two hours you spend watching TV instead of pursuing something more active increases the chances of developing diabetes by 20 percent; it also increases the risk of heart disease (15 percent) and early death (13 percent).<br><br>Type 2 diabetes used to be called adult onset diabetes, and is striking people at younger and younger ages with rates skyrocketing globally. The good news is that it’s highly preventable.<br><br>Go for healthier protein sources instead, such as nuts, beans, poultry, and fish.<br><br>A diet high in vegetables and whole grains can keep blood sugar and appetite in check. Choose a good variety of whole grain foods prepared in interesting ways.<br><br>Cut back on refined carbs and sugary drinks: White bread, white rice, white pasta and potatoes cause quick increases in blood sugar, as do sugary soft drinks, fruit punch, and fruit juice. Over time, eating lots of these refined carbohydrates and sugar may increase your risk of type 2 diabetes. To lower your risk, switch to whole grains and skip the sugar — especially the sugary drinks.<br><br><b><i>Choose whole grains and whole grain products over highly processed carbohydrates:</i></b><br><br>Diets rich in whole grains protect against diabetes, whereas diets rich in refined carbohydrates lead to increased risk.<br><br>Choosing a diet rich in whole grains and healthy fats adds even more protection—skip the refined grains and sugary soda.<br><br>Averaged two to three servings of whole grains a day were 30 percent less likely to have developed type 2 diabetes than those who rarely ate whole grains.<br><br>Eating an extra 2 servings of whole grains a day decreased the risk of type 2 diabetes by 21 percent.<br><br>Dietary fiber can reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes by several mechanisms. Dietary fiber may slow glucose absorption from the intestine, which lowers the glycemic index of carbohydrates (Livesey., 2009).<br><br><b><i>Skip the sugary drinks, and choose water, coffee, or tea instead:</i></b><br><br>Like refined grains, sugary beverages have a high glycemic load, and drinking more of this sugary stuff is associated with increased risk of diabetes.<br><br>Women who drank one or more sugar-sweetened beverages per day had an 83 percent higher risk of type 2 diabetes, compared to women who drank less than one sugar-sweetened beverage per month (Schulze et al., 2004). Sugary drinks contribute to chronic inflammation, high triglycerides, decreased “good” (HDL) cholesterol, and increased insulin resistance, all of which are risk factors for diabetes (Malik et al., 2010). Some studies have found that people who regularly drink diet beverages have a higher risk of diabetes than people who rarely drink such beverages.<br><br><b><i>Choose good fats instead of bad fats:</i></b><br><br>A diet rich in mono and polyunsaturated fats can help lower your risk of diabetes and heart disease. Canola oil and olive oil are great choices, as are the fats in avocados, nuts, and seeds.<br><br>Good fats, such as the polyunsaturated fats found in liquid vegetable oils, nuts, and seeds can help ward off type 2 diabetes. Trans fats do just the opposite. These bad fats are found in many margarines, packaged baked goods, fried foods in most fast-food restaurants, and any product that lists “partially hydrogenated vegetable oil” on the label.<br><br>Limit red meat and avoid processed meat; choose nuts, whole grains, poultry, or fish instead.<br><br>Meat consumption is associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes (Song., 2012).<br><br>Limiting red meat (beef, pork, lamb) and avoiding processed meat — including bacon, hot dogs, and deli meats — can also help lower diabetes risk.<br><br>Partial replacement of meat protein with soy protein improved insulin sensitivity and both total and LDL cholesterol concentrations in humans (Nielen et al., 2014).<br><br>Eating smaller amounts of processed red meat each day—just two slices of bacon, one hot dog, or the like—increased diabetes risk by 51 percent.<br><br>Swapping out red meat or processed red meat for a healthier protein source, such as nuts, low-fat dairy, poultry, or fish, or for whole grains lowered diabetes risk by up to 35 percent.<br><br>Smokers are roughly 50 percent more likely to develop diabetes than nonsmokers, and heavy smokers have an even higher risk.<br><br>Moderate amounts of alcohol—up to a drink a day for women, up to two drinks a day for men—increases the efficiency of insulin at getting glucose inside cells and decreases the risk of type 2 diabetes.<br><br><div class="text-center h4"><b>Exercise, eat healthily and not gain excess weight.</b></div><br><b><i>References:</i></b><br><ul class="margin-top-10"><li>van Nielen M, Feskens EJ, Rietman A, et al.
